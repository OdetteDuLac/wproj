    <h1>Waterways of Central Asia</h1>
    <p>In this project I experimented with mapping political boundaries with water rather than land in Central Asia. 
        I included lakes, whose depletion is a major concern in the region as far as access to freshwater, agricultural irrigation
        and the continuation of fishing operations, which is historically important to local economies. Furthermore, I included dams,
        which play a significant role in the water geopolitics of the region, as countries compete for access to freshwater from rivers, 
        particularly the Amu and Syr Daryas, which provide a large portion of water for agricultural irrigation. The map was done in a local projection.
