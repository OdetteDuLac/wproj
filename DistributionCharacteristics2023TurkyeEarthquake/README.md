# DistributionCharacteristics2023TurkyeEarthquake
Repository for Final Project on the 2023 distribution and characteristics of the 2023 T端rkiye-Syria earthquakes. 

## Summary

This project uses data from the USGS catalog and the UN OCHA HDX portal to examine the distribution and characteristics of 2023 T端rkiye-Syria earthquakes and their aftershocks within the borders of T端rkiye to understand the relationship between earthquake magnitude and depth. It also visually compares compares the occurrence of building destruction with these earthquake variables as well as the human response to the destruction, as represented by twitter activity.

## Scripts and Code
Code files in the Code folder, include .Rmd files from each contributor to assure proper version control as well as a final .Rmd file with all relevant code to the final outputs of the project. 

## Quality Assurance/Quality Control
Conducted early exploratory analysis of the data to assure that data relevant to analysis was included and that there were no null or confounding values.
