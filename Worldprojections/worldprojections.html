    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>  
    <p>I used the Natural Earth dataset to create the base map, and then using the Indicatrix plugin, I added an indicatrix layer to the basemap.
        Finally, I created maps by changing the CRS (Coordinate Reference System) in QGIS and trying out different world projections.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Standard projection used for GPS, Google Maps, and other webmaps.
        Based on the indicatrix, this projection is distorted in both shape and size
        as the distance from the equator increases.
    </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>Based on the indicatrix, this projection distorts size and shape the farther away
        a location is from the prime meridian or the equator.
    </h3>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>Pseudo Mercator Projection is similar to the 
        Mercator projection, except that the projection is done using a sphere instead of an ellipsoid. It preserves shape
        throughout the map; however size is distorted the farther a location is from the equator.
    </h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projeciton compares in some ways to the Aitoff projection. However, it's distortion does not appear to be as 
        dramatic as the distortion in the Aitoff projection because while the Sphere Winkel I still distorts size the farther away 
        a location is from the equator or the prime meridian, it does not distort shape in a noticable way.

    <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area World Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is interesting because it appears to preserve both shape and size in the central regions of the map,
        but a dramatic distortion is both shape and size is observable in the northernmost and southernmost regions.

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves both size and shape in the areas surrounding the North Pole; however, as locations near
        the South Pole both size and shape are greatly changed.
    </h3>

    <img src="./maps/54027_World_Equ_Dist_Conic.png" alt="Equidistant Conic" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection does not differ too gratly from the World Equidistant Conic Projection because based on the indicatrix,
        the least distorted areas are still those surrounding the North Pole. Nevertheless, the shape distortion near the South Pole in this azimuthal projection
        is even more pronounced than in the aforementioned conic projeciton.

    </a>
    <h2>World Polyconic Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection shape and size are best preserved near the equator and the prime meridian; however, interestingly
        this projeciton appears to preserve the size and shape of points surrounding both poles that are closest to the prime meridian. 
    </h3>

    <h2>Sphere Two Point Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>Based on the indicatrix, it appears that this projection preserves shape for the most part except maybe in the easternmost, 
        westernmost, and southernmost areas. Size on the other hand in distorted most in areas farthest form the prime meridian and the equator, although size 
        appears to be more uniform north of the equator than south of the equator, meaning the North Pole is less distorted than the South Pole.</h3>
